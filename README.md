Stock prices are extremely volatile.
As events affect our lives, we affect stock prices in turn.
So, in this second-hand way, events such as a breaking scandal or a natural disaster affect stock prices, often severely.

These events also affect social media for the simple reason that we talk online about what affects us in real life.
We try to find the third-hand relationship between social media and stock prices.
Our goal is to predict stock prices using data from social media


First, we pull real-time tweets about a specific company.
Then, we run sentiment analysis to find out what percentages of those tweets are positive, negative, and neutral.
With that data, we neural networks ML to predict stock prices.
Finally, we check our predictions against the something something to determine the presecence or lack of a correlation.

We present our findings in a website where you can search stocks.
